# # Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application
# 
# By the time you complete this notebook, you will have finished the last programming assignment of Week 4, and also the last programming assignment of Course 1! Go you! 
# 
# To build your cat/not-a-cat classifier, you'll use the functions from the previous assignment to build a deep network. Hopefully, you'll see an improvement in accuracy over your previous logistic regression implementation.  
# 
# **After this assignment you will be able to:**
# 
# - Build and train a deep L-layer neural network, and apply it to supervised learning
# 
# Let's get started!
#

# ## 2 - Load and Process the Dataset
# 
# You'll be using the same "Cat vs non-Cat" dataset as in "Logistic Regression as a Neural Network" (Assignment 2). The model you built back then had 70% test accuracy on classifying cat vs non-cat images. Hopefully, your new model will perform even better!
# 
# **Problem Statement**: You are given a dataset ("data.h5") containing:
#     - a training set of `m_train` images labelled as cat (1) or non-cat (0)
#     - a test set of `m_test` images labelled as cat and non-cat
#     - each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB).
# 
# Let's get more familiar with the dataset. Load the data by running the cell below.

# In[ ]:


train_x_orig, train_y, test_x_orig, test_y, classes = load_data()


# The following code will show you an image in the dataset. Feel free to change the index and re-run the cell multiple times to check out other images. 

# In[ ]:


# Example of a picture
index = 10
plt.imshow(train_x_orig[index])
print ("y = " + str(train_y[0,index]) + ". It's a " + classes[train_y[0,index]].decode("utf-8") +  " picture.")

num_px = train_x_orig.shape[1]
m_test = test_x_orig.shape[0]

print ("Number of testing examples: " + str(m_test))

print ("train_y shape: " + str(train_y.shape))
print ("test_x_orig shape: " + str(test_x_orig.shape))
print ("test_y shape: " + str(test_y.shape))


# As usual, you reshape and standardize the images before feeding them to the network. The code is given in the cell below.

# Reshape the training and test examples 
train_x_flatten = train_x_orig.reshape(train_x_orig.shape[0], -1).T   # The "-1" makes reshape flatten the remaining dimensions

# Standardize data to have feature values between 0 and 1.

# **Note**:
# $12,288$ equals $64 \times 64 \times 3$, which is the size of one reshaped image vector.

# ## 3 - Model Architecture

# <a name='3-1'></a>
# ### 3.1 - 2-layer Neural Network
# 
# Now that you're familiar with the dataset, it's time to build a deep neural network to distinguish cat images from non-cat images!
# 
# You're going to build two different models:
# 
# - A 2-layer neural network
# - An L-layer deep neural network
# 
# Then, you'll compare the performance of these models, and try out some different values for $L$. 
# 
# Let's look at the two architectures:
# 
# <img src="images/2layerNN_kiank.png" style="width:650px;height:400px;">
# <caption><center><font color='purple'><b>Figure 2</b>: 2-layer neural network. <br> The model can be summarized as: INPUT -> LINEAR -> RELU -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID -> OUTPUT.</font></center></caption>
# 
# <u><b>Detailed Architecture of Figure 2</b></u>:
# - The input is a (64,64,3) image which is flattened to a vector of size $(12288,1)$. 
# - The corresponding vector: $[x_0,x_1,...,x_{12287}]^T$ is then multiplied by the weight matrix $W^{[1]}$ of size $(n^{[1]}, 12288)$.
# - Then, add a bias term and take its relu to get the following vector: $[a_0^{[1]}, a_1^{[1]},..., a_{n^{[1]}-1}^{[1]}]^T$.
# - Multiply the resulting vector by $W^{[2]}$ and add the intercept (bias). 
# - Finally, take the sigmoid of the result. If it's greater than 0.5, classify it as a cat.
# 
# <a name='3-2'></a>
# ### 3.2 - L-layer Deep Neural Network
# 
# It's pretty difficult to represent an L-layer deep neural network using the above representation. However, here is a simplified network representation:
# 
# <img src="images/LlayerNN_kiank.png" style="width:650px;height:400px;">
# <caption><center><font color='purple'><b>Figure 3</b>: L-layer neural network. <br> The model can be summarized as: [LINEAR -> RELU] $\times$ (L-1) -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID</font></center></caption>
# 
# <u><b>Detailed Architecture of Figure 3</b></u>:
# - The input is a (64,64,3) image which is flattened to a vector of size (12288,1).
# - The corresponding vector: $[x_0,x_1,...,x_{12287}]^T$ is then multiplied by the weight matrix $W^{[1]}$ and then you add the intercept $b^{[1]}$. The result is called the linear unit.
# - Next, take the relu of the linear unit. This process could be repeated several times for each $(W^{[l]}, b^{[l]})$ depending on the model architecture.
# - Finally, take the sigmoid of the final linear unit. If it is greater than 0.5, classify it as a cat.
# 
# <a name='3-3'></a>
# ### 3.3 - General Methodology
# 
# As usual, you'll follow the Deep Learning methodology to build the model:
# 
# 1. Initialize parameters / Define hyperparameters
# 2. Loop for num_iterations:
#     a. Forward propagation
#     b. Compute cost function
#     c. Backward propagation
#     d. Update parameters (using parameters, and grads from backprop) 
# 3. Use trained parameters to predict labels
# 
# Now go ahead and implement those two models!

# <a name='4'></a>
# ## 4 - Two-layer Neural Network
# 
# <a name='ex-1'></a>
# ### Exercise 1 - two_layer_model 
# 
# Use the helper functions you have implemented in the previous assignment to build a 2-layer neural network with the following structure: *LINEAR -> RELU -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID*. The functions and their inputs are:
# ```python
# def initialize_parameters(n_x, n_h, n_y):
#     ...
#     return parameters 
# def linear_activation_forward(A_prev, W, b, activation):
#     ...

# 
# **Note**: You may notice that running the model on fewer iterations (say 1500) gives better accuracy on the test set. This is called "early stopping" and you'll hear more about it in the next course. Early stopping is a way to prevent overfitting.

# ### Congrats! It seems that your 4-layer neural network has better performance (80%) than your 2-layer neural network (72%) on the same test set. 
# 
# This is pretty good performance for this task. Nice job! 
# 
# In the next course on "Improving deep neural networks," you'll be able to obtain even higher accuracy by systematically searching for better hyperparameters: learning_rate, layers_dims, or num_iterations, for example.  

# <a name='6'></a>
# ##  6 - Results Analysis
# 
# First, take a look at some images the L-layer model labeled incorrectly. This will show a few mislabeled images. 

# In[ ]:


print_mislabeled_images(classes, test_x, test_y, pred_test)


# **A few types of images the model tends to do poorly on include:** 
# - Cat body in an unusual position
# - Cat appears against a background of a similar color
# - Unusual cat color and species
# - Camera Angle
# - Brightness of the picture
# - Scale variation (cat is very large or small in image) 

# ### Congratulations on finishing this assignment! 
# 
# You just built and trained a deep L-layer neural network, and applied it in order to distinguish cats from non-cats, a very serious and important task in deep learning. ;) 
# 
# By now, you've also completed all the assignments for Course 1 in the Deep Learning Specialization. Amazing work! If you'd like to test out how closely you resemble a cat yourself, there's an optional ungraded exercise below, where you can test your own image. 
# 
# Great work and hope to see you in the next course! 

# <a name='7'></a>
# ## 7 - Test with your own image (optional/ungraded exercise) ##
# 
# From this point, if you so choose, you can use your own image to test  the output of your model. To do that follow these steps:
# 
# 1. Click on "File" in the upper bar of this notebook, then click "Open" to go on your Coursera Hub.
# 2. Add your image to this Jupyter Notebook's directory, in the "images" folder
# 3. Change your image's name in the following code
# 4. Run the code and check if the algorithm is right (1 = cat, 0 = non-cat)!

# In[ ]:


## START CODE HERE ##
my_image = "my_image.jpg" # change this to the name of your image file 
my_label_y = [1] # the true class of your image (1 -> cat, 0 -> non-cat)
