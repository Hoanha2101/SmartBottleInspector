# # Introduction to TensorFlow
# 
# Welcome to this week's programming assignment! Up until now, you've always used Numpy to build neural networks, but this week you'll explore a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks more easily. Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle, Torch, Caffe, Keras, and many others can speed up your machine learning development significantly. TensorFlow 2.3 has made significant improvements over its predecessor, some of which you'll encounter and implement here!
# 
# By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to do the following in TensorFlow 2.3:
# 
# * Use `tf.Variable` to modify the state of a variable
# * Explain the difference between a variable and a constant
# * Train a Neural Network on a TensorFlow dataset
# 
# Programming frameworks like TensorFlow not only cut down on time spent coding, but can also perform optimizations that speed up the code itself. 
# 
# ## Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader
# 
# Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:
# 
# 1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.
# 2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.
# 3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.
# 4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.
# 5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.
# 
# If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader Error: Grader feedback not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/supplement/QWEnZ/h-ow-to-refresh-your-workspace).

# ## 2 - Basic Optimization with GradientTape
# 
# The beauty of TensorFlow 2 is in its simplicity. Basically, all you need to do is implement forward propagation through a computational graph. TensorFlow will compute the derivatives for you, by moving backwards through the graph recorded with `GradientTape`. All that's left for you to do then is specify the cost function and optimizer you want to use! 
# 
# When writing a TensorFlow program, the main object to get used and transformed is the `tf.Tensor`. These tensors are the TensorFlow equivalent of Numpy arrays, i.e. multidimensional arrays of a given data type that also contain information about the computational graph.
# 
# Below, you'll use `tf.Variable` to store the state of your variables. Variables can only be created once as its initial value defines the variable shape and type. Additionally, the `dtype` arg in `tf.Variable` can be set to allow data to be converted to that type. But if none is specified, either the datatype will be kept if the initial value is a Tensor, or `convert_to_tensor` will decide. It's generally best for you to specify directly, so nothing breaks!
# 

# Here you'll call the TensorFlow dataset created on a HDF5 file, which you can use in place of a Numpy array to store your datasets. You can think of this as a TensorFlow data generator! 
# 
# You will use the Hand sign data set, that is composed of images with shape 64x64x3.

# ### 2.1 - Linear Function
# 
# Let's begin this programming exercise by computing the following equation: $Y = WX + b$, where $W$ and $X$ are random matrices and b is a random vector. 
# 
# <a name='ex-1'></a>
# ### Exercise 1 - linear_function
# 
# Compute $WX + b$ where $W, X$, and $b$ are drawn from a random normal distribution. W is of shape (4, 3), X is (3,1) and b is (4,1). As an example, this is how to define a constant X with the shape (3,1):
# ```python
# X = tf.constant(np.random.randn(3,1), name = "X")
# 
# ```
# Note that the difference between `tf.constant` and `tf.Variable` is that you can modify the state of a `tf.Variable` but cannot change the state of a `tf.constant`.
# 
# You might find the following functions helpful: 
# - tf.matmul(..., ...) to do a matrix multiplication
# - tf.add(..., ...) to do an addition
# - np.random.randn(...) to initialize randomly

# ### 2.2 - Computing the Sigmoid

# ### 2.3 - Using One Hot Encodings
# 
# Many times in deep learning you will have a $Y$ vector with numbers ranging from $0$ to $C-1$, where $C$ is the number of classes. If $C$ is for example 4, then you might have the following y vector which you will need to convert like this:
# 
# 
# <img src="images/onehot.png" style="width:600px;height:150px;">
# 
# This is called "one hot" encoding, because in the converted representation, exactly one element of each column is "hot" (meaning set to 1). To do this conversion in numpy, you might have to write a few lines of code. In TensorFlow, you can use one line of code: 
# 
# - [tf.one_hot(labels, depth, axis=0)](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/one_hot)
# 
# `axis=0` indicates the new axis is created at dimension 0
# 
# <a name='ex-3'></a>
# ### Exercise 3 - one_hot_matrix
# 
# Implement the function below to take one label and the total number of classes $C$, and return the one hot encoding in a column wise matrix. Use `tf.one_hot()` to do this, and `tf.reshape()` to reshape your one hot tensor! 
# 
# - `tf.reshape(tensor, shape)`

# ### 2.4 - Initialize the Parameters 
# 
# Now you'll initialize a vector of numbers with the Glorot initializer. The function you'll be calling is `tf.keras.initializers.GlorotNormal`, which draws samples from a truncated normal distribution centered on 0, with `stddev = sqrt(2 / (fan_in + fan_out))`, where `fan_in` is the number of input units and `fan_out` is the number of output units, both in the weight tensor.

# ### 3.2 Compute the Total Loss
# 
# All you have to do now is define the loss function that you're going to use. For this case, since we have a classification problem with 6 labels, a categorical cross entropy will work!
# 
# You are used to compute the cost value which sums the losses over the whole batch (i.e. all mini-batches) of samples, then divide the sum by the total number of samples. Here, you will achieve this in two steps. 
# 
# In step 1, the `compute_total_loss` function will only take care of summing the losses from one mini-batch of samples. Then, as you train the model (in section 3.3) which will call this `compute_total_loss` function once per mini-batch, step 2 will be done by accumulating the sums from each of the mini-batches, and finishing it with the division by the total number of samples to get the final cost value.
# 
# Computing the "total loss" instead of "mean loss" in step 1 can make sure the final cost value to be consistent. For example, if the mini-batch size is 4 but there are just 5 samples in the whole batch, then the last mini-batch is going to have 1 sample only. Considering the 5 samples, losses to be [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] respectively, we know the final cost should be their average which is 2. Adopting the "total loss" approach will get us the same answer. However, the "mean loss" approach will first get us 1.5 and 4 for the two mini-batches, and then finally 2.75 after taking average of them, which is different from the desired result of 2. Therefore, the "total loss" approach is adopted here. 
# 
# <a name='ex-6'></a>
# ### Exercise 6 -  compute_total_loss
# 
# Implement the total loss function below. You will use it to compute the total loss of a batch of samples. With this convenient function, you can sum the losses across many batches, and divide the sum by the total number of samples to get the cost value. 
# - It's important to note that the "`y_pred`" and "`y_true`" inputs of [tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/categorical_crossentropy) are expected to be of shape (number of examples, num_classes). 
# 
# - `tf.reduce_sum` does the summation over the examples.
# 
# - You skipped applying "softmax" in `Exercise 5` which will now be taken care by the `tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy` by setting its parameter `from_logits=True` (You can read the response by one of our mentors [here](https://community.deeplearning.ai/t/week-3-assignment-compute-total-loss-try-to-set-from-logits-false/243049/2?u=paulinpaloalto) in the Community for the mathematical reasoning behind it.

# **Note:** When using sum of losses for gradient computation, it’s important to reduce the learning rate as the size of the mini-batch increases. This ensures that you don’t take large steps towards minimum.
# 
# <a name='3-3'></a>
# ### 3.3 - Train the Model
# 
# Let's talk optimizers. You'll specify the type of optimizer in one line, in this case `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam` (though you can use others such as SGD), and then call it within the training loop. 
# 
# Notice the `tape.gradient` function: this allows you to retrieve the operations recorded for automatic differentiation inside the `GradientTape` block. Then, calling the optimizer method `apply_gradients`, will apply the optimizer's update rules to each trainable parameter. At the end of this assignment, you'll find some documentation that explains this more in detail, but for now, a simple explanation will do. ;) 
# 
# 
# Here you should take note of an important extra step that's been added to the batch training process: 
# 
# - `tf.Data.dataset = dataset.prefetch(8)` 
# 
# What this does is prevent a memory bottleneck that can occur when reading from disk. `prefetch()` sets aside some data and keeps it ready for when it's needed. It does this by creating a source dataset from your input data, applying a transformation to preprocess the data, then iterating over the dataset the specified number of elements at a time. This works because the iteration is streaming, so the data doesn't need to fit into the memory.
