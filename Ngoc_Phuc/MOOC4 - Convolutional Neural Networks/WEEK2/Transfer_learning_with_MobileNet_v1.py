# # Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2

# Welcome to this week's assignment, where you'll be using transfer learning on a pre-trained CNN to build an Alpaca/Not Alpaca classifier!
# 
# <img src="images/alpaca.png" style="width:300px;height:220px;">
# 
# A pre-trained model is a network that's already been trained on a large dataset and saved, which allows you to use it to customize your own model cheaply and efficiently. The one you'll be using, MobileNetV2, was designed to provide fast and computationally efficient performance. It's been pre-trained on ImageNet, a dataset containing over 14 million images and 1000 classes.
# 
# By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:
# 
# - Create a dataset from a directory
# - Preprocess and augment data using the Sequential API
# - Adapt a pretrained model to new data and train a classifier using the Functional API and MobileNet
# - Fine-tune a classifier's final layers to improve accuracy
#

# When training and evaluating deep learning models in Keras, generating a dataset from image files stored on disk is simple and fast. Call `image_data_set_from_directory()` to read from the directory and create both training and validation datasets. 
# 
# If you're specifying a validation split, you'll also need to specify the subset for each portion. Just set the training set to `subset='training'` and the validation set to `subset='validation'`.
# 
# You'll also set your seeds to match each other, so your training and validation sets don't overlap. :)

# ## 2 - Preprocess and Augment Training Data
# 
# You may have encountered `dataset.prefetch` in a previous TensorFlow assignment, as an important extra step in data preprocessing. 
# 
# Using `prefetch()` prevents a memory bottleneck that can occur when reading from disk. It sets aside some data and keeps it ready for when it's needed, by creating a source dataset from your input data, applying a transformation to preprocess it, then iterating over the dataset one element at a time. Because the iteration is streaming, the data doesn't need to fit into memory.
# 
# You can set the number of elements to prefetch manually, or you can use `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE` to choose the parameters automatically. Autotune prompts `tf.data` to tune that value dynamically at runtime, by tracking the time spent in each operation and feeding those times into an optimization algorithm. The optimization algorithm tries to find the best allocation of its CPU budget across all tunable operations. 
# 
# To increase diversity in the training set and help your model learn the data better, it's standard practice to augment the images by transforming them, i.e., randomly flipping and rotating them. Keras' Sequential API offers a straightforward method for these kinds of data augmentations, with built-in, customizable preprocessing layers. These layers are saved with the rest of your model and can be re-used later.  Ahh, so convenient! 
# 
# As always, you're invited to read the official docs, which you can find for data augmentation [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation).

# ## 3 - Using MobileNetV2 for Transfer Learning 
# 
# MobileNetV2 was trained on ImageNet and is optimized to run on mobile and other low-power applications. It's 155 layers deep (just in case you felt the urge to plot the model yourself, prepare for a long journey!) and very efficient for object detection and image segmentation tasks, as well as classification tasks like this one. The architecture has three defining characteristics:
# 
# *   Depthwise separable convolutions
# *   Thin input and output bottlenecks between layers
# *   Shortcut connections between bottleneck layers
# 
# <a name='3-1'></a>
# ### 3.1 - Inside a MobileNetV2 Convolutional Building Block
# 
# MobileNetV2 uses depthwise separable convolutions as efficient building blocks. Traditional convolutions are often very resource-intensive, and  depthwise separable convolutions are able to reduce the number of trainable parameters and operations and also speed up convolutions in two steps: 
# 
# 1. The first step calculates an intermediate result by convolving on each of the channels independently. This is the depthwise convolution.
# 
# 2. In the second step, another convolution merges the outputs of the previous step into one. This gets a single result from a single feature at a time, and then is applied to all the filters in the output layer. This is the pointwise convolution, or: **Shape of the depthwise convolution X Number of filters.**
# 
# <img src="images/mobilenetv2.png" style="width:650px;height:450px;">
# <caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> <b>Figure 1</b> </u><font color='purple'>  : <b>MobileNetV2 Architecture</b> <br> This diagram was inspired by the original seen <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/04/mobilenetv2-next-generation-of-on.html#:~:text=MobileNetV2%20is%20a%20significant%20improvement,object%20detection%20and%20semantic%20segmentation.">here</a>.</center></caption>
# 
# Each block consists of an inverted residual structure with a bottleneck at each end. These bottlenecks encode the intermediate inputs and outputs in a low dimensional space, and prevent non-linearities from destroying important information. 
# 
# The shortcut connections, which are similar to the ones in traditional residual networks, serve the same purpose of speeding up training and improving predictions. These connections skip over the intermediate convolutions and connect the bottleneck layers. 

# Let's try to train your base model using all the layers from the pretrained model. 
# 
# Similarly to how you reused the pretrained normalization values MobileNetV2 was trained on, you'll also load the pretrained weights from ImageNet by specifying `weights='imagenet'`. 

# In[ ]:


IMG_SHAPE = IMG_SIZE + (3,)
base_model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(input_shape=IMG_SHAPE,
                                               include_top=True,
                                               weights='imagenet')


# Print the model summary below to see all the model's layers, the shapes of their outputs, and the total number of parameters, trainable and non-trainable. 

# In[ ]:


base_model.summary()


# Note the last 2 layers here. They are the so called top layers, and they are responsible of the classification in the model

# In[ ]:


nb_layers = len(base_model.layers)
print(base_model.layers[nb_layers - 2].name)
print(base_model.layers[nb_layers - 1].name)


# Notice some of the layers in the summary like `Conv2D` and `DepthwiseConv2D` and how they follow the progression of expansion to depthwise convolution to projection. In combination with BatchNormalization and ReLU, these make up the bottleneck layers mentioned earlier.

# <font color='blue'>
# 
# **What you should remember**:
# 
# * MobileNetV2's unique features are: 
#   * Depthwise separable convolutions that provide lightweight feature filtering and creation
#   * Input and output bottlenecks that preserve important information on either end of the block
# * Depthwise separable convolutions deal with both spatial and depth (number of channels) dimensions

# Next, choose the first batch from the tensorflow dataset to use the images, and run it through the MobileNetV2 base model to test out the predictions on some of your images. 

# In[ ]:


image_batch, label_batch = next(iter(train_dataset))
feature_batch = base_model(image_batch)
print(feature_batch.shape)


# In[ ]:


#Shows the different label probabilities in one tensor 
label_batch


# Now decode the predictions made by the model. Earlier, when you printed the shape of the batch, it would have returned (32, 1000). The number 32 refers to the batch size and 1000 refers to the 1000 classes the model was pretrained on. The predictions returned by the base model below follow this format:
# 
# First the class number, then a human-readable label, and last the probability of the image belonging to that class. You'll notice that there are two of these returned for each image in the batch - these the top two probabilities returned for that image.

# In[ ]:


base_model.trainable = False
image_var = tf.Variable(preprocess_input(image_batch))
pred = base_model(image_var)

tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.decode_predictions(pred.numpy(), top=2)


# Uh-oh. There's a whole lot of labels here, some of them hilariously wrong, but none of them say "alpaca."
# 
# This is because MobileNet pretrained over ImageNet doesn't have the correct labels for alpacas, so when you use the full model, all you get is a bunch of incorrectly classified images.
# 
# Fortunately, you can delete the top layer, which contains all the classification labels, and create a new classification layer.

# <a name='3-2'></a>
# ### 3.2 - Layer Freezing with the Functional API
# 
# <img src="images/snowalpaca.png" style="width:400px;height:250px;">
# 
# In the next sections, you'll see how you can use a pretrained model to modify the classifier task so that it's able to recognize alpacas. You can achieve this in three steps: 
# 
# 1. Delete the top layer (the classification layer)
#     * Set `include_top` in `base_model` as False
# 2. Add a new classifier layer
#     * Train only one layer by freezing the rest of the network
#     * As mentioned before, a single neuron is enough to solve a binary classification problem.
# 3. Freeze the base model and train the newly-created classifier layer
#     * Set `base model.trainable=False` to avoid changing the weights and train *only* the new layer
#     * Set training in `base_model` to False to avoid keeping track of statistics in the batch norm layer

# The results are ok, but could be better. Next, try some fine-tuning.

# <a name='3-3'></a>
# ### 3.3 - Fine-tuning the Model
# 
# You could try fine-tuning the model by re-running the optimizer in the last layers to improve accuracy. When you use a smaller learning rate, you take smaller steps to adapt it a little more closely to the new data. In transfer learning, the way you achieve this is by unfreezing the layers at the end of the network, and then re-training your model on the final layers with a very low learning rate. Adapting your learning rate to go over these layers in smaller steps can yield more fine details - and higher accuracy.
# 
# The intuition for what's happening: when the network is in its earlier stages, it trains on low-level features, like edges. In the later layers, more complex, high-level features like wispy hair or pointy ears begin to emerge. For transfer learning, the low-level features can be kept the same, as they have common features for most images. When you add new data, you generally want the high-level features to adapt to it, which is rather like letting the network learn to detect features more related to your data, such as soft fur or big teeth. 
# 
# To achieve this, just unfreeze the final layers and re-run the optimizer with a smaller learning rate, while keeping all the other layers frozen.
# 
# Where the final layers actually begin is a bit arbitrary, so feel free to play around with this number a bit. The important takeaway is that the later layers are the part of your network that contain the fine details (pointy ears, hairy tails) that are more specific to your problem.
# 
# First, unfreeze the base model by setting `base_model.trainable=True`, set a layer to fine-tune from, then re-freeze all the layers before it. Run it again for another few epochs, and see if your accuracy improved!

# 
# * To adapt the classifier to new data: Delete the top layer, add a new classification layer, and train only on that layer
# * When freezing layers, avoid keeping track of statistics (like in the batch normalization layer)
# * Fine-tune the final layers of your model to capture high-level details near the end of the network and potentially improve accuracy 

# ## Congratulations!
# 
# You've completed this assignment on transfer learning and fine-tuning. Here's a quick recap of all you just accomplished:
# 
# * Created a dataset from a directory
# * Augmented data with the Sequential API
# * Adapted a pretrained model to new data with the Functional API and MobileNetV2
# * Fine-tuned the classifier's final layers and boosted the model's accuracy
# 
# That's awesome!
