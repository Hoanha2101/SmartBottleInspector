## **Architecture, way of doing things**

The product is an application to check product defects on the bottled water production line system.
The product includes 3 modules corresponding to each stage of packaging a bottle of water before bringing the product to market:

- BOTTLE CHECK: check whether the shape of the water bottle matches the water bottle standards set by the manufacturer.
- WATER LEVEL CHECK: check whether the water level matches the standard water level, not higher, not lower.
- LABEL CHECK: check the integrity of the label.

## **STEP**

### **DEFINE SOLUTION**
With our product, to achieve the purpose of applying the product in practice, it is imperative that the product be deployed in real time, while achieving high accuracy, not affected by the environment.
We have streamlined the models as much as possible to reduce the use of multiple models, to accommodate deployment to mini hardware, such as Jetson nano, etc.
We do not use image processing methods here, because image processing depends heavily on the background.

Currently, the system operates with one main thread, processing frames received from three cameras one after another.

### **DETECTION MODEL**
We use the Yolov8 model, it is a SOTA detection model at the present time (December 20, 2023).
Use the parameters of the pretrain model (Yolov8m) to initialize the parameters quickly.
Through experiments, we have found that labeling the space above the water level will produce better detection results than labeling the exact black area of Pepsi water.

### **WATER LEVEL CHECK**

With this module we use the detect function of the yolov8m model. Use algorithms to eliminate areas of void above the water level if the intersection area between the void object above the water level and the water bottle is less than a threshold, which has been previously set.

Besides building the model, we also design an ideal background for the model to perform its tasks well, without interference from the outside environment.

### **WATER LEVEL CHECK**
Just detect two objects with the trained yolo model, then use the algorithm to manage which water level range belongs to which water bottle, then calculate the height threshold.

### **LABEL CHECK**

With this module, we continue to train the detection model with Yolov8, we proceed to label the training set, with 2 objects: label and water bottle. We can absolutely use the pre-trained model with classes = 39 of yolov8 or train a model ourselves to accurately identify the water bottle object, then extract the label region using image processing.
