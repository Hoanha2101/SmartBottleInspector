# ### 1.1 - Load the Data and Split the Data into Train/Test Sets
# 
# You'll be using the Happy House dataset for this part of the assignment, which contains images of peoples' faces. Your task will be to build a ConvNet that determines whether the people in the images are smiling or not -- because they only get to enter the house if they're smiling!  

# In[5]:


X_train_orig, Y_train_orig, X_test_orig, Y_test_orig, classes = load_happy_dataset()

# Normalize image vectors
X_train = X_train_orig/255.
X_test = X_test_orig/255.

# Reshape
Y_train = Y_train_orig.T
Y_test = Y_test_orig.T

print ("number of training examples = " + str(X_train.shape[0]))
print ("number of test examples = " + str(X_test.shape[0]))
print ("X_train shape: " + str(X_train.shape))
print ("Y_train shape: " + str(Y_train.shape))
print ("X_test shape: " + str(X_test.shape))
print ("Y_test shape: " + str(Y_test.shape))


# You can display the images contained in the dataset. Images are **64x64** pixels in RGB format (3 channels).

# In[6]:

# ## 2 - Layers in TF Keras 
# 
# In the previous assignment, you created layers manually in numpy. In TF Keras, you don't have to write code directly to create layers. Rather, TF Keras has pre-defined layers you can use. 
# 
# When you create a layer in TF Keras, you are creating a function that takes some input and transforms it into an output you can reuse later. Nice and easy! 

# <a name='3'></a>
# ## 3 - The Sequential API
# 
# In the previous assignment, you built helper functions using `numpy` to understand the mechanics behind convolutional neural networks. Most practical applications of deep learning today are built using programming frameworks, which have many built-in functions you can simply call. Keras is a high-level abstraction built on top of TensorFlow, which allows for even more simplified and optimized model creation and training. 
# 
# For the first part of this assignment, you'll create a model using TF Keras' Sequential API, which allows you to build layer by layer, and is ideal for building models where each layer has **exactly one** input tensor and **one** output tensor. 
# 
# As you'll see, using the Sequential API is simple and straightforward, but is only appropriate for simpler, more straightforward tasks. Later in this notebook you'll spend some time building with a more flexible, powerful alternative: the Functional API. 
#  

# <a name='3-1'></a>
# ### 3.1 - Create the Sequential Model
# 
# As mentioned earlier, the TensorFlow Keras Sequential API can be used to build simple models with layer operations that proceed in a sequential order. 
# 
# You can also add layers incrementally to a Sequential model with the `.add()` method, or remove them using the `.pop()` method, much like you would in a regular Python list.
# 
# Actually, you can think of a Sequential model as behaving like a list of layers. Like Python lists, Sequential layers are ordered, and the order in which they are specified matters.  If your model is non-linear or contains layers with multiple inputs or outputs, a Sequential model wouldn't be the right choice!
# 
# For any layer construction in Keras, you'll need to specify the input shape in advance. This is because in Keras, the shape of the weights is based on the shape of the inputs. The weights are only created when the model first sees some input data. Sequential models can be created by passing a list of layers to the Sequential constructor, like you will do in the next assignment.
# 
# <a name='ex-1'></a>
# ### Exercise 1 - happyModel
# 
# Implement the `happyModel` function below to build the following model: `ZEROPAD2D -> CONV2D -> BATCHNORM -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> FLATTEN -> DENSE`. Take help from [tf.keras.layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers) 
# 
# Also, plug in the following parameters for all the steps:
# 
#  - [ZeroPadding2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/ZeroPadding2D): padding 3, input shape 64 x 64 x 3
#  - [Conv2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D): Use 32 7x7 filters, stride 1
#  - [BatchNormalization](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization): for axis 3
#  - [ReLU](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/ReLU)
#  - [MaxPool2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MaxPool2D): Using default parameters
#  - [Flatten](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Flatten) the previous output.
#  - Fully-connected ([Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense)) layer: Apply a fully connected layer with 1 neuron and a sigmoid activation. 
#  
#  
#  **Hint:**
#  
#  Use **tfl** as shorthand for **tensorflow.keras.layers**

# Now that your model is created, you can compile it for training with an optimizer and loss of your choice.

This is one of the many optimizations built into TensorFlow that make your life easier! If you'd like to read more on how the compiler operates, check the docs [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#compile).

# <a name='3-2'></a>
# ### 3.2 - Train and Evaluate the Model
# 
# After creating the model, compiling it with your choice of optimizer and loss function, and doing a sanity check on its contents, you are now ready to build! 
# 
# Simply call `.fit()` to train. That's it! No need for mini-batching, saving, or complex backpropagation computations. That's all been done for you, as you're using a TensorFlow dataset with the batches specified already. You do have the option to specify epoch number or minibatch size if you like (for example, in the case of an un-batched dataset).

# In[ ]:


happy_model.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=16)


# After that completes, just use `.evaluate()` to evaluate against your test set. This function will print the value of the loss function and the performance metrics specified during the compilation of the model. In this case, the `binary_crossentropy` and the `accuracy` respectively.

# In[ ]:


happy_model.evaluate(X_test, Y_test)


# Easy, right? But what if you need to build a model with shared layers, branches, or multiple inputs and outputs? This is where Sequential, with its beautifully simple yet limited functionality, won't be able to help you. 
# 
# Next up: Enter the Functional API, your slightly more complex, highly flexible friend.  

# <a name='4'></a>
# ## 4 - The Functional API

# Welcome to the second half of the assignment, where you'll use Keras' flexible [Functional API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional) to build a ConvNet that can differentiate between 6 sign language digits. 
# 
# The Functional API can handle models with non-linear topology, shared layers, as well as layers with multiple inputs or outputs. Imagine that, where the Sequential API requires the model to move in a linear fashion through its layers, the Functional API allows much more flexibility. Where Sequential is a straight line, a Functional model is a graph, where the nodes of the layers can connect in many more ways than one. 
# 
# In the visual example below, the one possible direction of the movement Sequential model is shown in contrast to a skip connection, which is just one of the many ways a Functional model can be constructed. A skip connection, as you might have guessed, skips some layer in the network and feeds the output to a later layer in the network. Don't worry, you'll be spending more time with skip connections very soon!

# ### 4.1 - Load the SIGNS Dataset

# As a reminder, the SIGNS dataset is a collection of 6 signs representing numbers from 0 to 5.

# Loading the data (signs)

# 
# The next cell will show you an example of a labelled image in the dataset. Feel free to change the value of `index` below and re-run to see different examples. 

# In[80]:


# Example of an image from the dataset
index = 9
plt.imshow(X_train_orig[index])
print ("y = " + str(np.squeeze(Y_train_orig[:, index])))


# <a name='4-2'></a>
# ### 4.2 - Split the Data into Train/Test Sets
# 
# In Course 2, you built a fully-connected network for this dataset. But since this is an image dataset, it is more natural to apply a ConvNet to it.
# 
# To get started, let's examine the shapes of your data. 

# In[81]:


X_train = X_train_orig/255.
X_test = X_test_orig/255.
Y_train = convert_to_one_hot(Y_train_orig, 6).T
Y_test = convert_to_one_hot(Y_test_orig, 6).T
print ("number of training examples = " + str(X_train.shape[0]))
print ("number of test examples = " + str(X_test.shape[0]))
print ("X_train shape: " + str(X_train.shape))
print ("Y_train shape: " + str(Y_train.shape))
print ("X_test shape: " + str(X_test.shape))
print ("Y_test shape: " + str(Y_test.shape))


# <a name='4-3'></a>
# ### 4.3 - Forward Propagation
# 
# In TensorFlow, there are built-in functions that implement the convolution steps for you. By now, you should be familiar with how TensorFlow builds computational graphs. In the [Functional API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional), you create a graph of layers. This is what allows such great flexibility.
# 
# However, the following model could also be defined using the Sequential API since the information flow is on a single line. But don't deviate. What we want you to learn is to use the functional API.
# 
# Begin building your graph of layers by creating an input node that functions as a callable object:
# 
# - **input_img = tf.keras.Input(shape=input_shape):** 
# 
# Then, create a new node in the graph of layers by calling a layer on the `input_img` object: 
# 
# - **tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters= ... , kernel_size= ... , padding='same')(input_img):** Read the full documentation on [Conv2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D).
# 
# - **tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D(pool_size=(f, f), strides=(s, s), padding='same'):** `MaxPool2D()` downsamples your input using a window of size (f, f) and strides of size (s, s) to carry out max pooling over each window.  For max pooling, you usually operate on a single example at a time and a single channel at a time. Read the full documentation on [MaxPool2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MaxPool2D).
# 
# - **tf.keras.layers.ReLU():** computes the elementwise ReLU of Z (which can be any shape). You can read the full documentation on [ReLU](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/ReLU).
# 
# - **tf.keras.layers.Flatten()**: given a tensor "P", this function takes each training (or test) example in the batch and flattens it into a 1D vector.  
# 
#     * If a tensor P has the shape (batch_size,h,w,c), it returns a flattened tensor with shape (batch_size, k), where $k=h \times w \times c$.  "k" equals the product of all the dimension sizes other than the first dimension.
#     
#     * For example, given a tensor with dimensions [100, 2, 3, 4], it flattens the tensor to be of shape [100, 24], where 24 = 2 * 3 * 4.  You can read the full documentation on [Flatten](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Flatten).
# 
# - **tf.keras.layers.Dense(units= ... , activation='softmax')(F):** given the flattened input F, it returns the output computed using a fully connected layer. You can read the full documentation on [Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense).
# 
# In the last function above (`tf.keras.layers.Dense()`), the fully connected layer automatically initializes weights in the graph and keeps on training them as you train the model. Hence, you did not need to initialize those weights when initializing the parameters.
# 
# Lastly, before creating the model, you'll need to define the output using the last of the function's compositions (in this example, a Dense layer): 
# 
# - **outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=6, activation='softmax')(F)**
# 
# 
# #### Window, kernel, filter, pool
# 
# The words "kernel" and "filter" are used to refer to the same thing. The word "filter" accounts for the amount of "kernels" that will be used in a single convolution layer. "Pool" is the name of the operation that takes the max or average value of the kernels. 
# 
# This is why the parameter `pool_size` refers to `kernel_size`, and you use `(f,f)` to refer to the filter size. 
# 
# Pool size and kernel size refer to the same thing in different objects - They refer to the shape of the window where the operation takes place. 

# <a name='ex-2'></a>
# ### Exercise 2 - convolutional_model
# 
# Implement the `convolutional_model` function below to build the following model: `CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> FLATTEN -> DENSE`. Use the functions above! 
# 
# Also, plug in the following parameters for all the steps:
# 
#  - [Conv2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D): Use 8 4 by 4 filters, stride 1, padding is "SAME"
#  - [ReLU](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/ReLU)
#  - [MaxPool2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MaxPool2D): Use an 8 by 8 filter size and an 8 by 8 stride, padding is "SAME"
#  - **Conv2D**: Use 16 2 by 2 filters, stride 1, padding is "SAME"
#  - **ReLU**
#  - **MaxPool2D**: Use a 4 by 4 filter size and a 4 by 4 stride, padding is "SAME"
#  - [Flatten](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Flatten) the previous output.
#  - Fully-connected ([Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense)) layer: Apply a fully connected layer with 6 neurons and a softmax activation.

# **Congratulations**! You've finished the assignment and built two models: One that recognizes  smiles, and another that recognizes SIGN language with almost 80% accuracy on the test set. In addition to that, you now also understand the applications of two Keras APIs: Sequential and Functional. Nicely done!
